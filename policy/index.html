                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide and improve Markie's core functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Receipt parsing:</strong> Images or audio you provide are sent to our backend service
                        for processing. This service uses AI to extract structured receipt data (merchant, date,
                        category, items, totals, and commands).</li>
                    <li><strong>Data storage:</strong> Parsed receipt information is stored in association with your
                        signed-in user account for review, editing, and future reference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice-based editing:</strong> Voice commands allow you to review, edit, and correct
                        parsed receipts manually or using voice-based edit commands.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI insights:</strong> Your receipt data may be used to generate summaries and insights
                        about your spending patterns.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="policy-section">
                <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
                <p><strong>Backend Processing:</strong> Receipt parsing and voice editing are performed by a backend
                    service. User-provided content (images or audio) is sent to this backend service only to process
                    and extract structured receipt data. This data is used only to generate receipt information and is
                    associated with the signed-in user.</p>
                <p><strong>Cloud Synchronization:</strong> Parsed receipt data is stored using Firebase Firestore and
                    synchronized across your devices when you are signed in.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Your receipt data remains in our system until you choose to delete
                    it or delete your account.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="policy-section">
                <h2>In-Progress Receipts</h2>
                <p>If parsing is in progress, receipts may temporarily appear with an "in progress" indicator. During
                    this time, the receipt is being processed by our backend service. Once processing is complete, the
                    parsed data becomes available for your review and editing.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="policy-section">
                <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use Firebase (Google Cloud) for authentication and cloud
                        storage, and third-party services for AI-powered receipt parsing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to
                        protect our rights and safety.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="policy-section">
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secure authentication via Firebase Authentication</li>
                    <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
                    <li>Secure cloud storage with Firebase Firestore</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your
                    information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
